SUMMARY="Typesafe callback system for standard C++"
DESCRIPTION='
libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++. It
allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any
callback function, either global or a member function, regardless of
whether it is static or virtual.

libsigc++ is used by gtkmm to wrap the GTK+ signal system. It does not
depend on GTK or gtkmm.
