SUMMARY="Low-level library for netfilter related kernel/userspace communication"
DESCRIPTION="
libnfnetlink is the low-level library for netfilter related kernel/userspace
communication. It provides a generic messaging infrastructure for in-kernel
netfilter subsystems (such as nfnetlink_log, nfnetlink_queue,
nfnetlink_conntrack) and their respective users and/or management tools in
userspace.

This library is not meant as a public API for application developers. It is
only used by other netfilter.org projects, such as libnetfilter_log,
libnetfilter_queue or libnetfilter_conntrack.
