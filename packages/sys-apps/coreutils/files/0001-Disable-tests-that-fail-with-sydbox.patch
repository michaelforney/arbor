Subject: [PATCH] Disable tests that fail with sydbox

Edit: Daniel Mierswa <impulze@impulze.org>
I removed the disabling of 2 tests here since they seem to work fine
with 7.5. There's another test failing on my machine (tail-2/assert)
but since it works for alip, let's see if more people run into it.

Edit: Elias Pipping <pipping@exherbo.org>
All but two tests that originally failed still do (the others are
skipped automatically if strace does not work). Made the patch apply
again
